# Launch-On-Boot-ng
<sub><sup>^it's like the original Launch-On-Boot but better^</sub></sup>
_Launches a TV app when the device boots_

On Google TV, there was a way to launch a specific app when the device booted. By default the device would display the TV stream, making the OS feel more like an overlay on top of your television than something completely isolated.

Android TV will simply just display the launcher on a reboot, a small distraction for users expecting to see TV and annoying for individuals using Android TV as a dumb kiosk displaying a single video or stream.

This app allows the user to select a specific app to open when the device boots or when the screen turns on. It's just that simple.
Any app can be opened. Alternatively, the default TV app (Live Channel) can be opened, returning you to the channel you just saw.
NOTE: Some manufacturers' TV app isn't showing up in Live Channels, ymmv.

Want to make your Android TV act more like a dumb TV? Want to launch Sling TV immediately? You should download this small utility app.
Is there someone in your house that leaves the volume too high? There is also an option for you - just use the mute switch!

You still here and not installing it already? See how it looks:
